    Extracts a vector of rates (a value for each location) associated with the
    requested class and line codes

    This seems more complicated/confusing than it really is, so it helps to
    look at an example. Consider that we have the following data passed to this
    template (assuming that this is the data that will exist at runtime):

      R = [ [ "A", "B" ], [ "C" ], [ "D", "E" ] ]
      C = [ [  1 ,  0  ], [  0  ], [  0,   1  ] ]
      L = "gl"

    Given matrix R (@rate_matrix@) and the classification matches C, for any
    index that matches the given line L, a dot product will be performed. Let
    us assume that indexes 0 and 2 match GL; we would then have the following
    dot product:

      R = [ [ "A", "B" ], ..., [ "D", "E" ] ]
      C = [ [  1 ,  0  ], ..., [  0,   1  ] ]
        = [   "A",                    "E"   ]

    And so the resulting vector would be [ "A", "E" ]. To put this into an
    example within the context of dwelling, let C above be the classification
    set for all vacant buildings. Then, [ "A", "E" ] would be the rate
    associated with the vacant building class code for locations 0 and 2
    respectively.

    If multiple matches are found per location, then the two rates will be
    summed (as that is how dot products work), which is obviously not good.
    However, this should not be a problem, because you should not have
    duplicate class codes per location. Fix your data if that happens.

    (Note that the dot product is actually performed for each index and then
    multiplied by the classification match __CMATCH__, so while the effect
    above is true, the result is achieved in a slightly different manner.)
