  Stub vectors and classifications of various lengths---%
    as well as the means of producing arbitrary lengths---%
    are provided for convenience and testing.


  <section title="Stub Vectors">
    Ten n-vectors with each element containing the value~$0$ are
      provided.

    <t:for-each-n start="1" end="10" step="1">
      <t:n-vector n="@current_n@" name="NVEC{@current_n@}"
                  value="0" />
    </t:for-each-n>


    <section title="Sequence Vectors">
      Sequence n-vectors are of length~$n$ and have a sequence of values
        from~$0$ to~$n-1$.

      <t:for-each-n start="1" end="10" step="1">
        <t:n-vector n="@current_n@" name="NVEC{@current_n@}_SEQ" />
      </t:for-each-n>
    </section>
  </section>



  <section title="Stub Classifications">
    Ten n-classes generated from the respective n-vectors are provided.

    <t:for-each-n start="1" end="10" step="1">
      <classify as="nclass{@current_n@}" yields="nClass{@current_n@}"
                desc="Classification {@current_n@}-vector">
        <match on="NVEC{@current_n@}" value="ZERO" />
      </classify>
    </t:for-each-n>
  </section>



  <section title="Vector Generation">
    \ref{_n-vector_} generates vector constants of length~$n$ where each
      element is assigned the provided value (or~$0$ if unspecified).
